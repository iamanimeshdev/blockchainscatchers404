Built on the Solana blockchain, the app leverages Vitcoin (our cryptocurrency) as the medium for payments, enabling peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. Students can list assignments they need help with, find tutors or peers to assist them, and complete transactions securely using Vitcoin.
